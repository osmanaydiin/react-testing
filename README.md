# Testing React Emoji Search App with React Testing Library

This repository contains test cases I wrote for an existing React project (Emoji Search App) using **React Testing Library**.  
I did not develop the core application; my contribution is focused solely on implementing unit and integration tests to validate key functionalities.

## âœ… Test Coverage Includes:

- **Header Rendering**  
  Ensures that the app title/header is correctly rendered.

- **Initial Emoji List Rendering**  
  Verifies that the full emoji list is displayed when the app loads.

- **Search Functionality**  
  Confirms that the emoji list filters correctly based on user input.

- **Copy to Clipboard**  
  Checks that clicking on an emoji copies it to the clipboard.

## ðŸ—‚ Test Files

- `App.test.js`  
- `src/tests/EmojiResults.test.js`

These tests aim to demonstrate practical usage of **React Testing Library** in verifying UI behavior and user interaction.
